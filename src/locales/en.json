      {
        "q": "If it's Open Source, why do I have to pay?",
        "a": "BlinkDo's source code is 100% free and available on GitHub under GPL-3.0 license. You can compile it yourself for free. But compiling, signing an app, and configuring automatic updates takes time and technical skills. The paid license ($29 lifetime) gives you a ready-to-use version: signed, notarized, with automatic updates. It's a huge time saver. And it funds full-time development of the app."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is it really a one-time payment? No hidden subscription?",
        "a": "Yes, really. $29 once, and it's yours forever. No subscription, no recurring fees, no tricks. All future updates are included for life. No \"version 2.0\" paywall, no premium features. Everything is included."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is my data really 100% private?",
        "a": "Absolutely. BlinkDo stores all your data locally on your machine, in a simple JSON file. Nothing is sent to the internet, no servers, no cloud. The code is Open Source, you can verify yourself. Your ideas stay with you."
      },
      {
        "q": "Do I need to create an account?",
        "a": "No! That's one of the great advantages of BlinkDo. Download, install, and you're set. Your data stays on your machine, no account required. You just enter your license key after purchase, and that's it."
      },
      {
        "q": "Does the 14-day free trial require a credit card?",
        "a": "No. You can download BlinkDo and try it for 14 full days without entering any credit card. At the end of the trial, you decide whether to buy or not. No pressure."
      },
      {
        "q": "Which platforms does BlinkDo run on?",
        "a": "BlinkDo is available on macOS (10.13+), Windows (10+) and Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch). The app is native on each platform for optimal performance. One license works on all platforms."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I use my license on multiple devices?",
        "a": "The Solo license ($29) works on 1 device. The Pro license ($49) works on up to 3 devices. If you compile yourself from GitHub, there are no limitations."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I customize the keyboard shortcut?",
        "a": "Absolutely! While Shift+Space is the default shortcut (and recommended for its simplicity), you can customize it in settings according to your preferences."
      },
      {
        "q": "Does it slow down my computer?",
        "a": "Not at all. BlinkDo uses less than 50MB of RAM in the background and has no impact on your system performance. It's optimized to be invisible until you need it."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I organize my tasks by project or category?",
        "a": "Yes! BlinkDo supports multi-lists, tags, and filters to organize your tasks as you wish. All while keeping the interface simple and fast."
      },
      {
        "q": "What happens if I accidentally close the app?",
        "a": "Nothing serious! All your tasks are automatically saved in real time to a local file. Even if you restart your computer, everything will be there on next launch."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is there a refund policy?",

        "q": "How can I contribute to the source code?",
